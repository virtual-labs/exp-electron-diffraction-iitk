1.	Load the TEM sample<br>
2.	Capture the appropriate pattern from the certain portion of the bright field image.<br>
3.	Observe the symmetry of crystal from various orientations. Note that you will have to index the zone axis later. Here you can only capture the diffraction patterns.<br>
4.	Ensure that a single crystal is in view, otherwise overlapping diffraction patterns will be obtained.<br>
5.	For a poly-crystalline material (usually nanocrystalline) will elicit a ring pattern. As the crystals are aligned in all the directions, the orientation correlation (or estimation of zone axis) will not be possible.<br>
6.	For an amorphous material only a halo around the central beam is obtained as there is no symmetry available for diffraction.<br>
