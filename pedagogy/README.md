#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Students select the region and obtain the diffraction pattern from various materials and understand the concept of electron diffraction. | Simulator enables to select the sample and select the region of interest  | To educate the concept of electron diffraction.
2.| Student will select the relevant area | It enable to obtain the diffraction pattern from the selected area  | To educate the importance of region of sample
3.| Student will observe the diffraction pattern from single crystal or diffraction from powder sample | Enable diffraction from single crystal or powder sample | To observe diffraction pattern and differentiate it from diffraction rings
4.| Student will observe the diffraction from deformed samples | Enable diffraction from deformed material  | Observe change in the diffraction due to material deformation
5.| Student will observe the diffraction from amorphous sample | Enable diffraction from amorphous material  | Observe the diffused rings from amorphous material
